# Windows Dev Setup

    You can get clone this where ever I guess, mine is on my desktop atm.
    This is just my attempt at stream-lining my dev set up process on fresh windows installs.
    This will probably be heavily maintained for the like a week then i'll forget about it for a year.
    But hey, I don't think my dev experience needs to change that much during that time right?

# Usage

    Just git clone this bad boy and run ./DevSetup.ps1 in the windows terminal (I'm defaulting to PS)
    You can also use my terminal_settings.json just make sure to change like assets for the background pictures to your choice.
    Currently i'm running a nice picture of Igris, I like it.

# Comments

    Dev Experiences are painfully subjective, if you don't like it that is okay.

# Future work

    I'mma try to make like, a dry-run flag, specific filters to only install certain things and some stuff like that.
